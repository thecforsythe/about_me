  <h1>Education</h1>
  <p>
    There's not really much to say here,
    I graduated from high school in May
    of 2014 and was accepted to the Iowa
    State University engineering program.
    However, I did not go and decided to
    go straight for a full time job.
  </p>

  <h1>Working Experience</h1>
  <p>
    My first job was working for a grocery
    chain called Hy-Vee, cooking in the
    kitchen. Here, I started to pick up
    more and more hours leading up to my high
    school graduation. My main goal at that point
    was to earn a fulltime position. After a
    little over a year the hard work paid off
    and I was officially a fulltime employee.

    <li>2 years as kitche clerk at Hy-Vee</li>
    <li>6 months as line cook at Hy-Vee</li>
